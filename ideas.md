#List of all the ideas im having

##On Shape classes (Rect, Cross):
- Add a thin/thick parameter on Cross (to filter)
- *DONE* Create a new elipsis class *DONE*
- Create a noise method for rooms (change the layout inside them)

##On GameMap class
- Improve the tunnel methods
- Study depper on new PCG methods, specially Cellular Automata
- Organize the code further
- Think of a better way of doing place_entities, think about the future scaling of things

##General
- Start implementing a debugging method (prob. with logging to check stuff)
- Think constantly on my arquitecture, read more on this, ECS!!
- Keep trimming down on my ideas
- Better way to organize stuff, to access stuff, debug stuff, basically everything xD
- HAVE FUN :3

##Gameplay Mechanics "brainmap"
- Focus on one at a time
- Think about CORE GAME, CORE MECHANICS, CORE CORE
    - *COMBAT* : Elements, Interactions, etc
    - *MAP* : DG/Landscape PCG, stylize more
    - *UI* : very basic stuff, char stats, console, inventory?
    - *PLOT* : have a Plot obj to control the story options and stuff
